# Changelog

## 0.1.6

- Fixed the visible Classic right-edge color interruption between the title bar and content area.
- Root cause: the title gradient extended to the window edge while the content area used a 7 logical px gray side rail.
- Inset the Classic title gradient by the same 7 logical px used by the content layout.
- Added continuous left and right gray side rails spanning the full window height.
- Moved the final outer and inner frame strokes to the end of Classic background painting.
- Repainted the logo and close button above the side rails to preserve their appearance.
- Applied the continuity fix symmetrically to both left and right edges.
- Kept window size, row height, result columns, colors and Modern Compact geometry unchanged.
- Bumped application, manifest and Windows resource version to 0.1.6.


## 0.1.5

- Froze the already-matched Classic window geometry and result-table layout.
- Recalibrated the title gradient to be darker on the left and brighter on the right.
- Softened the horizontal title-bar scanlines.
- Redrew the clean-room launcher emblem with a less circular blue folded form and a larger orange star.

- Bumped application, manifest and Windows resource version to 0.1.5.


## 0.1.3

- Rebuilt Classic mode against a real user-provided old ALTRun screenshot instead of generic Win32 styling.
