## About

Asterun is a native, lightweight, keyboard-first launcher for Windows 10/11, designed to make the **search → focus → launch** loop fast enough to disappear into your daily workflow.

Built with C++23 + Win32, Asterun brings application discovery, pinyin and mixed-language search, usage-aware ranking, smart numeric launch, user shortcuts, optional Everything file/folder search, native update/uninstall support, and a portable data model into one compact launcher experience.

## v1.0.1 — In Development

Asterun 1.0.1 is undergoing real-machine validation, focusing on the transparent brand icon and a fix for the invisible background-process path when the primary hotkey is unavailable. The current stable release remains v1.0.0. Detailed release history is kept in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Highlights

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Native and lightweight** | C++23 + Win32, designed for fast startup and a small portable footprint. |
| **Two launcher styles** | Classic ALTRun-inspired UI and a Modern Compact Windows-oriented UI. |
| **Keyboard-first workflow** | Default global launcher hotkey is <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>. |
| **Smart search** | Fuzzy matching, English initials, Chinese full-pinyin / pinyin-initial matching, and mixed-language queries. |
| **Usage-aware ranking** | Frequency and recency help frequently used results move closer to the top. |
| **Smart numeric launch** | Optional 1–9,0 quick launch with typing-intent arbitration instead of blindly consuming number keys. |
| **Windows app discovery** | Start Menu, packaged/UWP/MSIX apps, App Paths and PATH providers. |
| **Everything integration** | Optional fast file/folder search with Asterun-managed acquisition or compatibility with external Everything installs. |
| **User shortcuts** | Native Shortcut Manager with aliases, arguments, working directories, dynamic input and path conversion. |
| **Portable data** | Settings, shortcuts, usage history and provider cache live under the local `data/` directory. |
| **Native lifecycle tools** | Built-in `Update.exe` and `Uninstall.exe`, with x64 and ARM64 release packages. |
| **Bilingual UI** | Simplified Chinese and English interfaces. |

## Quick Start

1. Download the package for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/Aspeternity/Asterun/releases/latest).
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice.
3. Run `Asterun.exe`.
4. Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the launcher.
5. Use the tray menu for **Settings**, **Shortcut Manager**, **About**, and exit controls.

Asterun is portable. On first launch it creates its runtime data directory beside the executable.

## Search Sources

Asterun can combine results from several Windows sources:

- Start Menu shortcuts
- Packaged / UWP / MSIX applications
- App Paths
- Executables available through `PATH`
- User-defined shortcuts
- Optional Everything file and folder results

Sources can be enabled or disabled independently from **Settings → Search Sources**.

## Everything File Search

Everything integration is optional.

When enabled from **Settings → Search Sources**, Asterun can guide you through **Get and start Everything**. The managed flow verifies the downloaded package before use and keeps its own managed service/runtime lifecycle separate from external user-managed Everything installations.

If you already maintain your own compatible Everything installation, Asterun is designed not to take ownership of that external installation.

## Launcher Styles

### Classic

The Classic style preserves the compact ALTRun-inspired layout and keyboard-centric interaction model. It includes authorized original visual/audio assets from classic ALTRun where noted below.

### Modern Compact

Modern Compact keeps the same search engine and result semantics while presenting a cleaner Windows 10/11-oriented shell with DPI-aware sizing and a compact result surface.

Both styles share the same search, ranking, shortcut and provider core.

## Portable Data

Runtime state is stored locally:

```text
Asterun/
├─ Asterun.exe
├─ Update.exe
├─ Uninstall.exe
├─ VERSION
├─ README.md
├─ dict/
├─ third_party/
└─ data/                  # created at runtime
   ├─ settings.json
   ├─ commands.json
   ├─ usage.json
   └─ provider-cache.json
```

Configuration files use versioned schemas, atomic writes and backup recovery. See [Config Core schemas](docs/CONFIG_SCHEMA.md) for implementation details.

## Release Channels

| Channel | Intended use | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stable** | Recommended for normal use. Versioned, immutable releases. | [Latest stable](https://github.com/Aspeternity/Asterun/releases/latest) |
| **Development** | Rolling build from the latest successful `main` CI. May contain unfinished changes. | [dev-latest](https://github.com/Aspeternity/Asterun/releases/tag/dev-latest) |

Official release assets include x64/ARM64 portable ZIPs, SHA-256 checksums and an update manifest.

## Build from Source

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**
- CMake **3.24+**
- Git

### x64

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### ARM64

Use a Visual Studio toolchain with ARM64 support:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-arm64 -A ARM64
cmake --build build-arm64 --config Release
```

CMake fetches pinned build dependencies used by the project. Release artifacts are additionally checked by CI for version consistency, package contents and runtime smoke behavior.
